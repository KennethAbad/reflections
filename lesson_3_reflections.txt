When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? You can use your remote repository when collaborating with a group project. It's also useful for keeping a backup in case something happens to your local files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? Manually pulling repositories will keep your local  and remote repositories synced.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? Forks are used when you want to make a copy of a github (remote) repository. Clones are downloaded projects and their entire version history that are stored in your local repository. Branches are used when making a building a feature that will contain errors. The main (master) branch should not contain errors in the project. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally? If a collaborator were to cause an error in the latest push, You can restore it to the last known state before the code was pushed.
