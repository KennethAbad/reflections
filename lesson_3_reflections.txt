When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? You can use your remote repository when collaborating with a group project. It's also useful for keeping a backup in case something happens to your local files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? Manually pulling repositories will keep your local  and remote repositories synced.
